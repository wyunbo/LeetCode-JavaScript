/**
 * Reverse String II
 *
 * Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters
 * for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.
 * If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them.
 * If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters,
 * then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
 * Output: "bacdfeg"
 *
 * Restrictions:
 * The string consists of lower English letters only.
 * Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]
